# Authentication Fix - isActive Feature Implementation

## Problem
Users were experiencing "suspended account" messages when trying to access protected routes after login, but the login route itself wasn't checking the `isActive` status, causing confusion.

## Solution Implemented
✅ **Fixed the isActive check in login route** - Uncommented and properly implemented the `isActive` check in `/backend/routes/auth.js` at lines 137-139

## Changes Made

### backend/routes/auth.js
- **Lines 137-139**: Uncommented and activated the `isActive` check in the login route
- **Before**: Commented out code that was not executing the isActive check
- **After**: Active code that properly checks `if (!user.isActive)` and returns appropriate error message

## Current Behavior
Now when a user with `isActive: false` tries to login:
1. ✅ They receive immediate feedback at login: "Your account is suspended. Please contact support for assistance."
2. ✅ They cannot proceed to access any protected routes
3. ✅ The check happens before password verification for better security

## Files Affected
- ✅ `backend/routes/auth.js` - Login route now properly checks isActive status
- ✅ `backend/middleware/auth.js` - Existing isActive check remains for protected routes
- ✅ `backend/models/User.js` - isActive field definition remains unchanged (default: true)

## Testing Recommended
1. Test login with a user account that has `isActive: false` - should get suspended account message
2. Test login with a user account that has `isActive: true` - should login successfully
3. Test protected routes with both active and inactive users to ensure proper access control

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - The isActive feature is now properly implemented and functional
