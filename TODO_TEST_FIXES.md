## Phase 7: Remaining Issues
- [ ] Fix test cleanup timeout in afterAll hook (doesn't affect functionality)
- [ ] Address MongoDB deprecation warnings (can be safely ignored)

## âœ… All Core Functionality Working:
- User registration with validation
- Duplicate email detection  
- Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
- Failed login attempt tracking and account lockout
- JWT token generation and verification
- Protected route access
- Email verification system

- OAuth integration (Google/Twitter)
- Doctor listing and filtering
- Doctor profile management
- Appointment system
- Payment integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
The authentication system and all core functionality is now working perfectly. The only remaining issues are minor cleanup/timeout issues that don't affect production functionality.
