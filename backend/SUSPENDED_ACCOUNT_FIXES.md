# Suspended Account Management - Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the suspended account management system, including new admin API endpoints for proper user account suspension and reactivation.

## Problems Addressed
1. ✅ **Lack of Admin Control**: No API endpoints for admins to suspend/reactivate user accounts
2. ✅ **Manual Process Only**: Only manual database updates or scripts could change account status
3. ✅ **No Admin Dashboard**: No way for admins to view user status or statistics

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. New Admin API Endpoints
Created comprehensive admin routes in `backend/routes/admin.js`:

**User Management:**
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List users with filtering (role, status, search)
- `GET /api/admin/users/:id` - Get user details
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/suspend` - Suspend user account
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/reactivate` - Reactivate user account

**Statistics:**
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - Get dashboard statistics

### 2. Security Features
- ✅ **Admin Authorization**: All endpoints require admin role (`authorize('admin')`)
- ✅ **Admin Protection**: Admin accounts cannot be suspended (security measure)
- ✅ **Account Lock Reset**: Reactivation resets failed login attempts and lock status
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Proper validation and error handling

### 3. Integration with Existing System
The new endpoints integrate seamlessly with:
- ✅ Existing `protect` and `authorize` middleware
- ✅ Current JWT token authentication system
- ✅ Existing `isActive` field checks in auth routes and middleware
- ✅ User model structure and validation

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `backend/routes/admin.js` - Completely rewritten with comprehensive admin endpoints

### Created Files:
- `backend/test-admin-routes.js` - Test script to verify functionality
- `backend/ADMIN_API_DOCS.md` - Complete API documentation

## Key Features

### Suspension Process:
1. Sets `isActive: false` on user account
2. User cannot login (blocked at auth route level)
3. User cannot access protected routes (blocked at middleware level)

### Reactivation Process:
1. Sets `isActive: true` on user account
2. Resets `failedLoginAttempts: 0`
3. Clears `accountLockedUntil: null`
4. User can login and access routes normally

### Admin Protection:
- Admin accounts (`role: 'admin'`) cannot be suspended
- Prevents accidental or malicious admin account suspension

## Testing

### Automated Test:
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd backend
node test-admin-routes.js
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Start server: `npm run dev`
2. Login as admin user to get JWT token
3. Test endpoints:
   - List users: `GET /api/admin/users`
   - Suspend user: `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/suspend`
   - Reactivate user: `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/reactivate`
   - Get stats: `GET /api/admin/stats`

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Full suspended account management system implemented

The system now provides:
- Complete admin control over user account status
- Proper security measures and validation
- Seamless integration with existing authentication
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
